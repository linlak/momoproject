## Momo Integration template ##

This template has been designed to help programmers who are new to composer to get started with the momo api integration  using linlak/momoapi PHP library. This project will help you to also load other third party libraries by using
	
	composer require <package name>
	
## Installation ##
To start a new project go to you project directory and open it in terminal or command prompt (cmd) for windows and enter the following commands.

**Note:** These instructions will walk you through the creating a new project that is psr7 compliant.


	composer create-project linlak/momoproject <myproject>
	
Replace my project with your project's name.

If you already have a project with composer you just have to run the command below.

	composer require linlak/momoapi
	

If you have already run the command above simply run
	
	composer update

Lets run through  the directory structure created


Now enter the following command to install dependencies

	composer  install
After running this command, you now have a folder called vendor. This is where all third party modules will be installed.

To install new libraries you will just need to run

	composer require <package name>
To update dependencies you run

	composer update

**Nice coding**
